SatPy: A Python Library for Weather Satellite Processing
--------------------------------------------------------

SatPy tries to abstract satellite data so can have a common standard.

Can make composites, can resample, can save to a GIS-friendly format.

Users need to be aware that the new paradigm is not to download data but to 
manipulate data where it is stored. 


How Python Packaging Works
--------------------------

wheel distributions replaced eggs. Used to distribute binaries.

Warehouse has replaced PyPI.


Lightning Talks
---------------

* `vaex` like pandas but for very large datasets. Also can calculate statistics.

* "`unyt` turns your python prompt into a superpwered physics calculator"
	[note: how to get something like this into my ATL02 suite?]

* `scientific python cookiecutter` generates templates for scientific packages.
