Democratizing Data
------------------

- Difference between Software as a Service and Research-driven:

	1. Many users v few
	2. Low understanding of the software v high

- How to value developers

	1. Give credit for software and good software development practices
	2. Career paths for research software development
	3. Information or access to resources on best/better practices (checklists, templates)
	4. Pay for open source software development

- "The Journal of Open Source Software"

	Can submit your software and will become a publication.

- Leaders need training.

- Most people want more training. 


Sample Statistical Distances
----------------------------

- Not enough to just use mean or percentile to pick out different distrubutions in a sample, such as anomalies.
  Need use multiple tests.

  * Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.
  - Earth-mover's distance.
  - Cramer-von Mises distance.
  	(both distances are available in scipy)


Scalable Feature Extraction with Aerial and Satellite Imagery
--------------------------------------------------------------

Segmentation code:

github.com/mapbox/robosat


SciPy Tools
-----------

`PyViz` makes various graphic packages play nice.


Reproducable Data with Reproducable Results
-------------------------------------------

`pulp` to package your code so it includes all dependencies. Hel


Lightning Talks
---------------

* To go from academia to industry: find target field where you can do what you really like, network, invest time in a pet projects, and interview early so you know what skills you need to develop.


* `splot` - lightweight plotting for geospatial analysis in PySAL. Visualizations in Jupyter. github.com/pysal/splot
